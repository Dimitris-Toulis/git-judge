# Git Commit Judge

This is a small ruby script that uses AI to judge git commits in different styles (constructive, critical, sassy). Features include:
- Uses github-linguist to discard diffs of autogenerated files to keep diffs inside the context length
- Colored output!
- Can select commits to judge based on ranges

## Usage
```
Usage: ruby main.rb [options]
    -r, --repo REPO_PATH             Path to the git repository
        --mode MODE                  Modes: constructive, critical, sass
        --range RANGE                Commit range to judge in format <commit1>..<commit2>
```
